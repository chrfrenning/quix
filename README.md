**quix** is a PyTorch framework for streamlining experiment design for ML tasks. 

## the TLDR;

building pipelines for large ML experiments for HPC is not only tedious, but boring. **quix** is here to help to make your life **queasier** by being a quick way to speed up your latest ML experiments.
 
- **quix** only requires you to
    - write a model
    - write a parser for your model
    - add some form of training config

you'll be up and running in no time! it's the **quix**$^{\mathrm{TM}}$ guarantee! **quix** will even support your favorite config format; `json`, `yaml` or argparse with command line arguments. hopefully your favorite format is in that list of three things. it's the **quix**$^{\mathrm{TM}}$ way!

of course, **quix** also allows you to extend your framework as you please, as long as you do it in a way **quix** understands!
the goal of **quix** is to abstract away the most common components of your training loop with pretty solid defaults and components so **YOU** can spend time on other things, like buying **quix**$^{\mathrm{TM}}$ merchandise, or even doing research! it is as **quix** and **queasy**$^{\mathrm{TM}}$ as you like!

## more speciquix

you can learn all about **quix** by looking really hard at the source code for a while. feel free to read the docstrings of some functions to understand more about **quix**!!! **quix** reminds you to look away if you feel queasy!
